# Opeartors are simple maths like : addition, multiplication, division, minus, But in python there some more operators like  modulus, floor Division, Exponential,

num1 = 5;
num2 = 3;

# modulus denoted by (%)
print(num1%num2);

# Floor Division denoted by (//)
print(num1//num2);

# modulus denoted by (**)
print(num1**num2);
